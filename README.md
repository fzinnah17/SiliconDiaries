About this web app: 
      
      In the fast-paced world of technology, it's essential for developers to pause, reflect, and monitor their well-being. "Silicon Valleys" serves as a digital sanctuary for tech professionals to document their daily feelings, achievements, and struggles. This platform emphasizes mindfulness, self-reflection, and proactive self-care.

Time spent: 10 hours

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] **The web app uses only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript without a frontend framework**
- [x] **The web app displays a title**
- [x] **The web app displays at least five list items, each with at least three attributes (such as title, text, and image URL)**
- [x] **The user can click on each item in the list to see a detailed view of it, including all database fields**
- [x] **The web app serves an appropriate 404 page when no matching route is defined**
- [x] **The web app is appropriately styled using Picocss**

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [x] The web app displays items in a unique format, as an accordion, rather than lists

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app or any additional context you'd like to add:
1. **ESM and Directory Paths:**
    - **Challenge:** When using ES6 modules (indicated by `import`/`export` syntax) in Node.js, traditional CommonJS variables `__filename` and `__dirname` are not available. 
    - **Solution:** I used the built-in `url` and `path` modules to recreate `__filename` and `__dirname` functionality. The lines:
        ```javascript
        const __filename = fileURLToPath(import.meta.url); // Get the filename of the current module
        const __dirname = dirname(__filename); // Get the directory name of the current module
        ```
      serve to define `__filename` and `__dirname` by transforming the module URL to a filesystem path.

2. **Checking Requested URLs:**
    - **Challenge:** It seems like there might have been an issue connecting to the HTML file or other static files. To debug, I checked each incoming request URL.
    - **Solution:** I added a middleware to log the request URLs to the console:
        ```javascript
        app.use((req, res, next) => {
            console.log("Request URL:", req.url);
            next();
        });
        ```
      This middleware prints the requested URL for every incoming request, which is useful for debugging connectivity or routing issues.

3. **Explicitly Serving main.js:**
    - **Challenge:** There was an issue with serving the `main.js` file using the regular static file-serving method of Express.js. 
    - **Solution:** To overcome this, I created a specific route just for `main.js` to ensure that it's correctly served:
        ```javascript
        app.get('/public/scripts/main.js', (req, res) => {
            const explicitPath = path.join(__dirname, '../client/public/scripts/main.js');
            res.sendFile(explicitPath);
        });
        ```
      This explicitly sets the path and serves `main.js` when its URL is requested.

4. **Issue with Static Files in the `/public` Directory:**
    - **Challenge:** I had an issue with serving static script files located in the `/public` directory.
    - **Solution:** I decided to serve all static files in the `/public` directory using:
        ```javascript
        app.use('/public', express.static(path.join(__dirname, '../client')));
        ```
      This command serves the static files present in the `/client` directory when a request comes in with the `/public` prefix.
